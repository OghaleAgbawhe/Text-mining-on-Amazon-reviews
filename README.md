# Text-mining-on-Amazon-reviews

#Project Goal
The goal of this project is to analyze various comments on food reviews from Amazon's platform. By utilizing different text mining techniques, it aims to extract valuable insights and feedback from customers. These insights will be packaged into an analytics product that can be offered to restaurants. The resultant product will enable restaurants to understand customer preferences, identify areas for improvement, and make informed decisions that enhance customer satisfaction and drive business growth. Ultimately, this project seeks to bridge the gap between customer feedback and actionable business intelligence, creating a tangible tool that aligns with the restaurant industry's unique needs.
